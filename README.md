## 1. Introduction to Transformers

The **Transformers** library by Hugging Face provides pre-trained models and tools to perform a variety of NLP tasks such as text classification, question answering, translation, summarization, and more. It's one of the most popular libraries in the machine learning community for natural language processing.

## 2. Getting Started

To begin using the Transformers library, you'll need to install it in your environment:

```bash
pip install transformers
```

Additionally, for tasks that require PyTorch or TensorFlow, you will need to install either one of these frameworks:

```bash
pip install torch  # for PyTorch
pip install tensorflow  # for TensorFlow
```

## 3. Core Concepts and Modules

Before diving into hands-on projects, you should familiarize yourself with the following core components of the Transformers library:

- **Modeling**: Using pre-trained models and fine-tuning them for specific tasks.
- **Tokenization**: Converting text into tokens for model input.
- **Pipeline**: Simplifies task-specific usage of models for tasks like text classification, named entity recognition (NER), etc.
- **Trainer API**: Helps in training and evaluating models.

### Key Libraries:
- `transformers`: The core library for models and tokenizers.
- `datasets`: For handling datasets easily.
- `huggingface_hub`: For interacting with the Hugging Face model hub.

## 4. Learning Path and Projects
